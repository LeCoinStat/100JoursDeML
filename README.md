# 100JoursDeML

**100JoursDeML** is a personal challenge to explore machine learning topics over
one hundred days. The repository collects the notebooks and slides used during
the journey. Most of the material is in French and follows the companion
[YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwGghwhk9Ak&list=PLyh35eYRez8e0KxsArawcDm6TYPVq0rU_&index=1).
